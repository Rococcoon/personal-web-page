        This project was an experiment in <b>HTMX</b>, <b>Web Components</b>, and <b>HATEOAS-driven design</b>, exploring how hypermedia can drive web applications without the complexity of client-side state management. Instead of following the common <b>React-style model</b>, where the frontend mutates state separately from the server, I focused on a hypermedia-first approach, allowing the server to dictate application state through structured responses.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges was <b>fighting against encapsulation</b> when integrating Web Components with HTMX. Shadow DOM is great for isolating styles and behavior, but it also breaks hypermedia’s natural ability to update the page fluidly. To reconcile this, I experimented with <b>light DOM rendering</b>, selectively exposing elements where necessary to keep HTMX's declarative updates intact.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        This project deepened my appreciation for <b>Go’s efficiency in server-side rendering</b>, the power of <b>hypermedia-driven architecture</b>, and the importance of <b>knowing when to enhance with JavaScript versus letting the server do the heavy lifting</b>.

I built a full-stack blog using Next.js, MongoDB, and NextAuth for authentication, creating a modern and scalable web application. The blog features a clean and responsive UI, allowing users to browse, read, and interact with posts seamlessly. With server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation (SSG), the site delivers fast performance while maintaining dynamic functionality.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
For user authentication, I integrated NextAuth, enabling secure sign-ins with provider GitHub, as well as email-based authentication. MongoDB serves as the database, efficiently storing and retrieving user-generated content. API routes in Next.js handle backend logic, making the application both performant and maintainable.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
This project was an opportunity to refine my skills in full-stack development, from database design to frontend UI/UX. I focused on building a smooth user experience, role-based access control, and a dashboard for managing content. The result is a flexible and scalable blogging platform that can be extended with additional features in the future.

I built a simple MonkeyType clone using Web Components, vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This lightweight typing app runs entirely in the browser without any frameworks, keeping the codebase clean and efficient. It features smooth animations, real-time accuracy tracking, and a minimal UI for distraction-free typing practice.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
This project was a fun experiment, inspired by my journey into touch typing on a split ergonomic keyboard. I wanted a custom typing tool to refine my skills while keeping the experience fast and intuitive. By focusing on pure web technologies, I ensured that the app remains highly responsive and works seamlessly across devices.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
Beyond improving my typing speed, this project deepened my understanding of Web Components and modular frontend development. It’s a simple yet effective tool, and I may expand it with features like custom word lists, themes, and typing analytics in the future.

Built an Arkanoid-style game using Raylib, following a tutorial as a foundation. Focused on modularizing C code, improving structure, and gaining a deeper understanding of Raylib’s game lifecycle and render cycles. Implemented core mechanics like paddle movement, ball physics, and brick collision detection.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
To make the game accessible on the web, I compiled it with Emscripten, converting the C code into WebAssembly. This allowed me to experiment with running native-like performance in the browser while learning about the nuances of WebAssembly and JavaScript interop. The project was a great introduction to game development, graphics programming, and optimizing C code for different platforms.
